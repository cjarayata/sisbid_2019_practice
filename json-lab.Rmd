1. Use Github API to get all of Hadley Wickham's repo data (username = "hadley")

```{r}
hadley_url <- "https://api.github.com/users/hadley/repos"


jsonData <- fromJSON(hadley_url)
date_read <- date()
```


2. How many stars does he have on each repository?

```{r}
jsonData$stargazers_count
```


3. How many open issues are there? 

```{r}
jsonData$open_issues_count
```


4. Create a new data frame consisting of just the "owner" column of the resulting data set called `owner_data`

```{r}

owner_data <- jsonData$owner

```


5. Add "owner_" to the name of all of the columns in this new data frame. You can use `names(owner_data) = paste0('owner_',names(owner_data))`

```{r}
names(owner_data) = paste0('owner_',names(owner_data))
```


6. Append these columns to the JSON data using the `cbind` command. 

```{r}
new_data <- cbind(jsonData, owner_data)
```
